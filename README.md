Collection of CNN and ResNet-based deep learning models for drone and image recognition tasks.

# üß† Deep Learning Portfolio

This repository showcases my experiments with deep learning models ‚Äî including CNNs and ResNets ‚Äî applied to drone image recognition and general image classification.

## üìÅ Projects

### 1. [Drone CNN](Drone_CNN/)
A convolutional neural network designed to classify drone images.

- Framework: TensorFlow / Keras  
- Features: Custom CNN architecture  
- Output: Drone category classification  
- Notebook: [`Drone_CNN.ipynb`](Drone_CNN/Drone_CNN.ipynb)

### 2. [ResNet Model](RestNet/)
A transfer learning experiment using **ResNet** for image recognition.

- Framework: PyTorch  
- Features: Transfer learning with pretrained ResNet  
- Output: High-accuracy image classification  
- Notebook: [`RestNet.ipynb`](RestNet/RestNet.ipynb)
